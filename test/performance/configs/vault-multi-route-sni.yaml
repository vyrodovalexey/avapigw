# Yandex Tank Configuration: Multiple Routes with Vault Certificates (SNI)
# Purpose: Measure SNI-based certificate selection performance with Vault certs
# Duration: 5 minutes total (1m warmup + 3m sustain + 1m cooldown)
# Target: 1500+ RPS across multiple SNI routes
#
# Test Case 4: Multiple Routes with Vault Certificates
# =====================================================
# Measures:
#   - SNI-based certificate selection latency
#   - Throughput with multiple Vault-issued route certs
#   - Compare with file-based route cert baseline
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - Each route has its own Vault-issued certificate
#   - SNI callback selects correct cert from route TLS manager
#   - Cert lookup is O(1) via map, no Vault API call
#   - Performance should be comparable to file-based route certs
#
# Baselines & Thresholds:
#   - p50 latency: < 5ms
#   - p95 latency: < 20ms
#   - p99 latency: < 50ms
#   - Error rate: < 0.1%
#   - Throughput: > 1500 RPS
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Vault running at localhost:8200 with PKI engine configured
#   - Gateway running with gateway-perftest-vault-sni.yaml config
#   - Backend services on ports 8801, 8802
