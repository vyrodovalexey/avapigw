# Yandex Tank Configuration: Capacity-Aware Load Balancer Test
# Purpose: Test load balancer performance when skipping hosts at capacity
# Tests: Host selection with capacity limits, failover behavior
# Duration: 10 minutes total (multiple phases)
#
# Test Phases:
# 1. Warmup (1m): Ramp from 50 to 200 RPS - well below capacity
# 2. Normal load (2m): Sustain at 200 RPS - within capacity
# 3. Approach capacity (1m): Ramp to 400 RPS - approaching limits
# 4. At capacity (3m): Sustain at 400 RPS - hosts at/near capacity
# 5. Over capacity (2m): Sustain at 600 RPS - all hosts at capacity
# 6. Cooldown (1m): Ramp down to 100 RPS
