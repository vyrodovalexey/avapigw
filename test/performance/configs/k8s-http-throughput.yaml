# Yandex Tank Configuration: K8s HTTPS GET Throughput Test
# Purpose: Measure HTTPS throughput for gateway deployed in local Kubernetes
# Duration: 30 seconds total (10s ramp + 15s sustain + 5s cooldown)
# Target: Conservative load for local K8s (Docker Desktop)
# Load: line(1, 50, 30s) - ramp from 1 to 50 RPS over 30s
#
# Note: The address port is dynamically replaced by run-k8s-test.sh
# with the actual K8s NodePort discovered via kubectl.
# SSL is enabled because K8s deployment uses Vault PKI for TLS.
