# Yandex Tank Configuration: HTTPS GET Throughput Test
# Purpose: Measure maximum throughput for HTTPS requests with TLS encryption
# Duration: 5 minutes total (1m warmup + 3m sustain + 1m cooldown)
# Target: 2000+ RPS
#
# This test is designed for HTTPS with Vault PKI certificates.
# The gateway should be configured with vault.pki.enabled=true.
